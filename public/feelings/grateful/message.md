My wonderful love,

A grateful heart is one of the most beautiful things in the world, and yours shines so brightly right now.

Thank you for noticing the blessings in your life. Thank you for counting the gifts, both big and small. That kind of awareness is rare and precious.

I want you to know—I am grateful for YOU. For your smile, your kindness, your spirit. You are one of the greatest blessings in my life.

May this gratitude continue to open your eyes to the abundance of love and beauty that surrounds you every single day.

With a grateful heart of my own 🤍
