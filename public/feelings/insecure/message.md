My beautiful love,

I wish you could see yourself the way I see you. The way God sees you.

When insecurity whispers that you're not enough, not smart enough, not pretty enough, not worthy enough—please know that those are lies. Every single one of them.

You were created on purpose, with purpose. Every detail of who you are was crafted with love and intention. There is no one else like you in all of creation, and the world needs exactly who you are.

Don't compare your behind-the-scenes to everyone else's highlight reel. You are remarkable just as you are.

Believing in you always 🤍
