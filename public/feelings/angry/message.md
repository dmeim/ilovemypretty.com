My darling,

Anger is a powerful emotion, and it's okay to feel it. Something happened that triggered this fire inside you, and those feelings are valid.

But I also know that anger, when it sits too long, can burn us more than anyone else. So feel it, acknowledge it, and then let it begin to pass.

What matters most right now is what you do with this anger. Don't let it consume you or make you do something you'll regret. Channel it into something constructive. Let it fuel positive change rather than destruction.

I'm here for you through the fire, and I'll be here when the flames die down.

Loving you through it 🤍
