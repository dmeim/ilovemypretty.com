My precious love,

I'm so sorry you're feeling lonely right now. That ache of feeling alone, even when surrounded by others, is one of the hardest things to bear.

But I want you to know—you are never truly alone. I am here, loving you from wherever I am. And even more than that, there is One who is always with you, who never leaves your side, who knows every thought and holds every tear.

Loneliness is a feeling, not a fact. The truth is that you are deeply loved, deeply valued, and deeply connected to hearts that cherish you.

Reach out when you're ready. I'm always here.

Holding you close in my heart 🤍
