My sweet love,

I can feel the weight you're carrying right now. That heaviness in your chest, that sorrow that seems to press down on your soul—I wish I could lift it for you.

It's okay to feel heavy-hearted. Life brings moments that weigh on us, and it's not weakness to feel the burden. But please know, you don't have to carry it alone.

Lean on me. Lean on the One who promises to give rest to the weary. Let yourself be held in this heavy moment.

This weight won't last forever. Lighter days are coming, I promise.

Carrying this with you 🤍
