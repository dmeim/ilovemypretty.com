My precious one,

Oh, that burning feeling of embarrassment. That wish you could disappear, rewind time, or wake up and find it was all just a dream. I know it feels unbearable right now.

But here's what I need you to know: whatever happened, it doesn't define you. Not for a second. We all have moments that make us cringe, moments we wish we could take back. That's part of being beautifully, messily human.

The people who truly love you? They're not replaying your embarrassing moment over and over. They've probably already moved on. And even if they haven't, their love for you is so much bigger than any awkward moment.

This feeling will fade, I promise. One day this might even become a funny story you tell. Until then, be gentle with yourself. You're allowed to be imperfect.

Still adoring you, awkward moments and all 🤍
