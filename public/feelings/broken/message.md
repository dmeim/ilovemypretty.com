My darling,

I know you're feeling broken right now, and my heart aches for you. Being broken is one of the most painful places to be—but I need you to know something important.

Broken things can be made whole again. In fact, some of the most beautiful things in this world were once broken. The Japanese have a practice called Kintsugi, where they mend broken pottery with gold, making it more beautiful than before.

God specializes in mending broken hearts. He collects every tear, binds every wound, and makes all things new. You are not beyond repair, my love. You are being made into something stronger, more beautiful, more compassionate.

I'm here, holding the pieces with you until they come back together.

You are loved, broken and all 🤍
