My weary love,

I can see you're tired. Not just sleepy, but that deep kind of tired that seeps into your bones and makes everything feel harder than it should be.

You've been giving so much of yourself, and it's okay to admit that you need rest. Rest is not weakness—it's wisdom. Even God rested on the seventh day.

Please take care of yourself today. Slow down if you can. Let some things wait. Your body and soul are telling you they need a break, and they deserve to be listened to.

I'm here, ready to take care of you however I can.

Rest well, my love 🤍
