My dear one,

There's too much. I know. The list is too long, the demands are too many, and you feel like you're drowning in it all.

But here's what I need you to do: stop. Just for a moment. Take a breath.

You don't have to do everything right now. You don't have to be everything to everyone. You just have to take one step, then another. One thing at a time.

When you feel like you can't do it all, remember—you were never meant to. You're meant to do what you can and trust God with the rest.

I'm here. We'll tackle this together, one piece at a time.

Breathing with you 🤍
