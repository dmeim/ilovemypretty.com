My dear love,

I know things feel unclear right now. You're not sure which way to go, what decision to make, or how to make sense of everything swirling around you.

It's okay not to have all the answers. It's okay to sit in the uncertainty for a while. You don't have to figure everything out today.

What I do know is this: clarity will come. It always does. And in the meantime, trust your heart, lean into wisdom, and know that you are being guided even when you can't see the path.

I'm here to think through things with you whenever you need.

Walking through the fog with you 🤍
