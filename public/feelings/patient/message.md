My patient love,

Patience is a quiet strength, and it's one of the most beautiful virtues. The fact that you're resting in patience right now shows so much wisdom and maturity.

In a world that moves so fast, choosing to wait, to trust the timing, to let things unfold in their own season—that takes real faith.

Whatever you're waiting for, I believe it will be worth it. The waiting season is not wasted time; it's preparation time. Growth time. Trust time.

I'm waiting alongside you, believing in the beautiful things to come.

Patiently loving you 🤍
