My brave one,

I'm so glad something has lifted your spirits and encouraged your heart today. You needed that reminder that you're not alone, that you are capable, that you can do this.

And you absolutely can.

Whatever challenge lies ahead, whatever mountain you're climbing, you have more strength than you know. And when your own strength runs out, there is a strength greater than yours ready to carry you through.

Keep going, my love. I believe in you. I always have, and I always will.

With all my heart 🤍
