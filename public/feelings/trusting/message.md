My faithful one,

Trust is one of the most beautiful gifts we can give—to God, to others, to the process of life itself. And I'm so glad you're resting in that trust right now.

When we trust, we let go of the need to control everything. We open our hands and our hearts, believing that we are guided, protected, and loved beyond measure.

Keep trusting, my love. Trust in the goodness of tomorrow. Trust in the faithfulness of the One who holds you. Trust that everything is working together for your good, even when you can't see the whole picture.

I trust in you, too.

With unwavering love 🤍
