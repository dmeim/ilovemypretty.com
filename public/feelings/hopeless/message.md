My precious darling,

Hopelessness is one of the darkest places the heart can go. When you can't see a way forward, when tomorrow looks as bleak as today, when you've lost the ability to imagine things getting better—I know how heavy that is.

But please hear me: this is not the end of your story.

Even in the darkest night, the sun is still there—just hidden. Dawn is coming, even if you can't see it yet. There is hope, even when you can't feel it.

Hold on. Please hold on. Better days are coming. I promise.

I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, holding hope for you until you can hold it yourself again.

Light in your darkness 🤍
