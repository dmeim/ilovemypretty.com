My unsettled love,

That restless feeling—like you can't sit still, can't find peace, can't settle into the present moment. It's exhausting, isn't it?

Restlessness often comes when our soul is searching for something. Maybe it's direction, maybe it's purpose, maybe it's just peace. Whatever it is, know that the answer is coming.

For now, try to be present. Ground yourself in this moment. Feel your feet on the floor, your breath in your lungs. You don't have to figure out everything right now.

True rest will come. Your soul will find its home.

Finding stillness with you 🤍
