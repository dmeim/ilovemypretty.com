My dearest,

There's something so beautiful about a thankful heart, and right now, yours is overflowing.

When we take the time to count our blessings, we realize just how abundant our lives really are. The small moments, the quiet mercies, the love that surrounds us—it all adds up to something so precious.

I'm thankful for you, my love. Thankful for every moment we share, every laugh, every quiet evening, every everything.

May your thankful heart continue to see the beauty in each new day.

With all my love 🤍
