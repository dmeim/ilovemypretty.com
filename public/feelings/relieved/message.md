My dear one,

Oh, that exhale of relief! I'm so happy that weight has been lifted from your shoulders. You've been carrying so much, and now you can finally breathe.

Take this moment to really let go. Let the tension melt away. Let your heart rate slow down. Let peace flood in where worry once lived.

Whatever it was that resolved, that worked out, that passed—you made it through. Just like I knew you would. You are stronger than you realize, and you've proven it once again.

Rest now. You've earned it.

So relieved with you 🤍
