Sweet love,

I'm so glad you're feeling at peace right now. In a world that's often so loud and chaotic, finding moments of true peace is such a gift.

Hold onto this stillness. Let it wash over you like gentle waves. You've earned this rest for your soul.

Peace doesn't mean everything around you is perfect—it means that despite the storms, you've found calm within. That takes such strength, and I'm so proud of you.

May this peace stay with you, wrapping around you like a warm blanket.

With all my love 🤍
