My depleted love,

You feel empty. Poured out. Like every bit of energy and life has been squeezed from you, leaving nothing behind.

I see how much you've been giving—to work, to people, to responsibilities. But you've been pouring from a cup that desperately needs refilling.

Today, let yourself receive instead of give. Let yourself be filled up again. It's not selfish—it's necessary. You can't pour from an empty vessel.

Rest. Be still. Let yourself be loved back to fullness.

Here to refill your cup 🤍
