My dear one,

I see you feeling stuck, like the walls are closing in and there's no way out. That suffocating sense that you're caught in something you can't escape. I'm so sorry you're feeling this way.

But I need you to hold onto this truth: no cage lasts forever. What feels permanent today is temporary. Circumstances change, doors open, walls come down. Sometimes the way out appears when we least expect it.

And even now, while you feel trapped, parts of you remain completely free. Your mind, your hope, your ability to dream of something better—no situation can take those from you.

Keep looking for the cracks of light. Keep believing there's a way through. Because there is, even if you can't see it yet. Freedom is coming for you.

Believing in your breakthrough 🤍
