My precious love,

I hate that something has hurt you. I wish I could take that pain away and make everything better right now.

Being hurt is one of the most vulnerable feelings. Whether it was words, actions, or circumstances—the wound is real, and you don't have to pretend it isn't.

Give yourself permission to grieve, to process, to heal. You don't have to rush through this or put on a brave face for anyone. Your hurt matters, and so does your healing.

I'm here to listen, to hold you, to sit with you in this pain for as long as you need.

Healing with you 🤍
