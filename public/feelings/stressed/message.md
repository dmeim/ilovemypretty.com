Hey love,

I can see you're feeling the pressure right now. The to-do list is long, the demands are many, and it feels like there's not enough of you to go around.

Please hear me: you are doing enough. You are enough. You don't have to be perfect or do everything perfectly. You just have to show up and do your best—and you're already doing that.

It's okay to take a break. It's okay to say no. It's okay to put down some of the weight you've been carrying. The world won't fall apart, I promise.

Take a moment right now to just breathe. I'm proud of you.

De-stressing with you 🤍
