My darling,

What a beautiful thing it is to see you so full of joy! Your joyful spirit is contagious, and it fills my heart with so much love.

True joy isn't just about the happy moments—it's that deep, abiding gladness that comes from knowing you are loved and cherished. And you are, my love. So very much.

Let this joy overflow from you and touch everyone around you. You have such a gift for bringing light into any room.

Savor this feeling. You deserve every ounce of it.

Forever yours 🤍
