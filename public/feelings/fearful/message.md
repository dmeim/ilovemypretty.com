My precious love,

I know fear has crept into your heart, making everything seem darker and more threatening than it really is. Fear has a way of doing that—magnifying dangers, stealing peace, whispering worst-case scenarios.

But I want you to know that you are protected. You are watched over. You are guarded by a love stronger than any fear.

When David walked through the valley of the shadow of death, he feared no evil—not because there was no danger, but because he knew he wasn't alone. And neither are you.

Look up, my love. Light is stronger than darkness, and love is stronger than fear.

Walking through the valley with you 🤍
