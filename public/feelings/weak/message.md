My precious one,

You're feeling weak right now, and that's okay. We all have moments when our strength fails us, when we can't do it on our own, when we need to lean on something greater.

Here's a beautiful secret: in our weakness, we find true strength. When we admit we can't do it alone, that's when help arrives. That's when grace steps in. That's when we discover that we don't have to carry everything ourselves.

You don't have to be strong all the time. Let yourself be held. Let yourself be carried. There is strength being offered to you right now.

Strong enough for both of us 🤍
