My honest love,

Jealousy is such a human feeling, and I appreciate you being honest about it. We've all looked at someone else's life, success, or blessings and felt that twinge of "why not me?"

But here's what jealousy doesn't see: you have your own blessings, your own path, your own gifts. Comparing your journey to someone else's is like comparing apples to oranges—they're just different, not better or worse.

Your story is being written just for you. Your timeline is perfect for you. And the blessings meant for you will find you.

Focus on your own garden, my love. Beautiful things are growing there.

Celebrating your unique journey 🤍
