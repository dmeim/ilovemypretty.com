My precious love,

Shame is one of the cruelest feelings. It tells you that you're not just flawed, but fundamentally broken. That you need to hide, to shrink, to disappear.

But that is a lie.

You are not defined by your mistakes, your past, or your lowest moments. You are defined by love—the love that created you, the love that surrounds you, the love that will never let you go.

You don't have to hide from me. You don't have to pretend. I see you—all of you—and I love what I see.

Step out of the shadows, my love. You belong in the light.

Seeing your beauty always 🤍
