Hey love,

I can tell you're frustrated right now, and I get it. Things aren't going the way you wanted, obstacles keep popping up, and it just feels like nothing is working.

It's okay to feel frustrated. It means you care, that you're trying, that you have goals and expectations. But please don't let frustration steal your peace or make you give up.

Take a step back. Breathe. Sometimes the breakthrough comes right after the breaking point. And even if the solution isn't clear yet, trust that it will come.

I believe in you. This frustration is temporary, but your strength is not.

In your corner always 🤍
