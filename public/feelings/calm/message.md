My beautiful one,

There's something so lovely about watching you rest in calmness. When your spirit is still and your heart is quiet, it's like seeing a beautiful lake with not a ripple on its surface.

In these calm moments, may you feel the gentle presence of love all around you. You are safe. You are held. You are protected.

I hope this calmness stays with you throughout your day, giving you the clarity and steadiness you need.

Be still, my love. Everything is going to be okay.

Yours always 🤍
