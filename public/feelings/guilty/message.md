My dear heart,

Guilt is heavy, I know. It sits on your chest and whispers that you're not good enough, that you've messed up too badly, that you don't deserve forgiveness.

But here's the beautiful truth: you are forgiven. Whether you're feeling guilty about something big or small, you don't have to carry that weight forever.

If you've done something wrong, acknowledge it, make amends where you can, and then—this is important—let it go. Holding onto guilt doesn't change the past; it only steals your present peace.

You are worthy of grace. You are worthy of a fresh start. And I love you, no matter what.

Forgiving and forgiven 🤍
