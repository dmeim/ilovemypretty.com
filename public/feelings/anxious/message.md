My sweet love,

I know that anxious feeling—the racing thoughts, the what-ifs, the knot in your stomach. It's exhausting, and I'm so sorry you're going through it right now.

But here's what I need you to remember: anxiety lies to you. It tells you things are worse than they are, that you can't handle it, that disaster is around every corner. Those are lies.

The truth is, you are capable. You are held. You are loved. And whatever is making you anxious—we can face it together.

Take a deep breath. Ground yourself in this moment. You are safe. You are okay. I promise.

Breathing with you 🤍
