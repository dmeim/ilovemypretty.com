My dear wanderer,

Feeling lost is such a lonely, disorienting experience. When you don't know where you are or where you're going, everything feels uncertain and overwhelming.

But I want you to know—even when you feel lost, you are not forgotten. You are seen. You are known. And you are being gently led back to where you need to be.

Sometimes we have to feel lost before we can truly be found. This season of wandering may be exactly what you need to discover something new about yourself, about life, about your path forward.

I'm here, holding a light for you until you find your way.

Never truly lost as long as you're loved 🤍
