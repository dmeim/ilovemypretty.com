My complete and beautiful love,

What a gift it is to feel whole. To sense all the pieces of yourself coming together, fitting into place, making you exactly who you were always meant to be.

This feeling—this wholeness—is your birthright. You were created complete, lacking nothing that truly matters. Every experience, every joy, every hardship has shaped you into this integrated, beautiful person standing here today.

Savor this moment. Let it sink deep into your bones. Remember what it feels like to be at peace with yourself, to feel complete just as you are.

You are not missing anything. You are not half of something waiting to be completed by someone else. You are whole, all on your own, and that is a beautiful thing.

Celebrating all of you 🤍
