My precious one,

I'm so happy you're feeling loved right now, because you ARE loved—more than words could ever express.

You are loved on your best days and your hardest days. You are loved when you're shining bright and when you're struggling in the dark. Nothing you could ever do would change that.

Let this feeling soak into every part of you. You are cherished. You are treasured. You are adored.

Never doubt for a moment how deeply and completely you are loved.

Forever and always 🤍
