My darling,

If only we could go back and do things differently. If only we could change that decision, unsay those words, choose another path. Regret is wishing we could rewrite history.

But we can't. And that's okay.

What we can do is learn. Grow. Become wiser because of what we've been through. Every regret can be transformed into wisdom if we let it teach us instead of torment us.

The past is behind you. The future is wide open. And you, my love, have the power to write a beautiful new chapter starting right now.

Looking forward with you 🤍
