My refreshed love,

There's nothing quite like the feeling of renewal—like fresh air filling your lungs, like the first rays of sun after a long night, like being made new again.

Whatever has brought you this sense of renewal, embrace it. You've been through so much, carried so much weight, and now you're emerging stronger, fresher, more alive.

This is your new beginning. The past is behind you, and before you lies a beautiful open road. Step forward with confidence, knowing that you are made new each and every day.

I'm so proud of how far you've come.

Forever in your corner 🤍
