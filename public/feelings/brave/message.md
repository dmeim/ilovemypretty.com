My courageous love,

Look at you, standing tall and brave! I am so incredibly proud of you right now.

Being brave doesn't mean you're not scared—it means you're choosing to move forward despite the fear. And that takes tremendous strength. Strength that you have in abundance.

Whatever you're facing, whatever has called for this courage within you, know that you are not facing it alone. I'm right beside you, cheering you on, believing in you with everything I have.

You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and more loved than you know.

Go show them what you're made of.

Proud of you always 🤍
