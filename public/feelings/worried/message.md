Hey love,

I know worry can feel overwhelming sometimes. It can make everything seem bigger and scarier than it really is. But I want you to know—you are not alone in this.

Take a deep breath with me. In... and out.

Whatever is on your mind, we can face it together. You don't have to carry this burden by yourself. I'm here, and more importantly, God is here.

Try to focus on what you can control, and let go of what you can't. And remember—you've made it through every difficult moment before this one. You're stronger than you know.

I believe in you, and I'm always in your corner.

With all my love 🤍
