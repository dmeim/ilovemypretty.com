My dear heart,

Sometimes we feel so much that we stop feeling at all. Numbness is the soul's way of protecting itself when everything becomes too much.

If you're feeling disconnected, empty, like you're just going through the motions—please know that this is temporary. Your feelings will return. The color will come back to your world.

For now, be gentle with yourself. Don't force yourself to feel anything. Just exist, just breathe, just be. The thawing will come in its own time.

I'm here, holding space for you until you feel like yourself again.

Patient and present 🤍
