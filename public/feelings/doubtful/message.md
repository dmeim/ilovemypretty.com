My precious one,

Doubt is part of the human experience. Even the greatest saints wrestled with doubt at times. So please don't be too hard on yourself for feeling this way.

Doubt doesn't mean your faith is weak—sometimes it means your faith is being tested and refined. It's okay to ask questions, to wonder, to not have it all figured out.

What matters is that even in your doubt, you keep reaching for truth. Keep asking. Keep seeking. The fact that you care enough to wrestle with these questions shows the depth of your heart.

I'm here to walk through the questions with you.

Believing alongside you 🤍
