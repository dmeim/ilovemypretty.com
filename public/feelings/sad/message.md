My sweet love,

I'm sorry you're feeling sad right now. I wish I could be there to hold you and let you know that everything is going to be okay.

It's okay to feel sad. It's okay to cry. Your feelings are valid, and you don't have to pretend to be okay when you're not.

Just know that even in your sadness, you are loved beyond measure. I'm here for you, whether you want to talk or just need someone to sit with you in silence.

This feeling won't last forever. The sun will shine again, and I'll be right here waiting with you until it does.

I love you so much 🤍
