My exhausted love,

You've been running on empty for too long, and now the tank is completely dry. Burnout isn't just tiredness—it's when you've given everything and have nothing left to give.

This is your sign to stop. Not slow down—stop.

You matter more than any task, any deadline, any responsibility. Your health—mental, physical, and spiritual—needs to come first right now.

It's okay to say no. It's okay to step back. It's okay to let some things fall so that you can stand again.

I'm here to help you find your way back to life.

Rebuilding with you 🤍
