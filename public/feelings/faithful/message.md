My steadfast love,

Faith is such a beautiful thing. It's believing without seeing, trusting without knowing the full plan, stepping forward even when the path isn't clear.

Your faithfulness—to God, to your values, to the people you love—is one of the things I admire most about you. It anchors you in storms and guides you through uncertainty.

Keep holding onto that faith. Even when it's as small as a mustard seed, it can move mountains. And I have seen your faith do extraordinary things.

You are a light in this world because of your faithful heart.

Believing with you 🤍
