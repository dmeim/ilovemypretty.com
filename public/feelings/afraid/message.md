My brave one,

Fear is such a human feeling. It's okay to be afraid. Even the bravest people feel fear—the difference is that they don't let it stop them.

Whatever is frightening you right now, know this: you don't have to face it alone. I'm here with you, and there is One greater than any fear who stands beside you, ready to give you strength.

Fear may whisper lies, but love speaks louder. And you, my darling, are so deeply loved that no fear can ever separate you from that love.

We'll get through this together. One step at a time.

Holding your hand through the fear 🤍
