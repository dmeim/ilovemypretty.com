My brave love,

I know you're feeling discouraged right now. The road has been long, the progress seems slow, and you're wondering if it's even worth continuing.

Please don't give up.

You may not see it, but you've come so far. Every step, even the small ones, has been building toward something. The finish line might not be visible yet, but that doesn't mean it isn't there.

Discouragement is just a feeling—it's not the truth about your situation or your future. You are capable. You are making progress. And you will get there.

I'm cheering for you, today and always.

Never giving up on you 🤍
