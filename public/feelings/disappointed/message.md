My sweet love,

Disappointment is one of the hardest feelings because it comes from hoping for something good. You had expectations, dreams, hopes—and they didn't work out the way you wanted.

I'm so sorry. I know how much that hurts.

But I want you to know that disappointment doesn't have to be the end of the story. Sometimes closed doors lead to better ones. Sometimes what looks like failure is actually redirection.

Your hopes are not foolish. Your dreams are not wasted. Keep believing in good things, even when they don't come in the packaging you expected.

Better things are coming. I'm sure of it.

Hoping with you 🤍
