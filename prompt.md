i will be using nfc cards to direct link to the /feeling/[feeling] routes and writing on the cards the feeling, like Happy, Sad, etc.

these are the color of sharpie markers i'll be using / have access too.

please go through all the config.json files and update the theming config to use the following colors, or colors that closely match so there is still some variations but it's still a close match. if there is some psychology something that can match the colors to feelings then all the better.
